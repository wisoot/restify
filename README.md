## Restify

Restify assists in transforming and choose what to be exposed from object passing from domain level to APIs such as Restful API. Also unlike traditional Restful API, Restify allows nested resources to be embedded with the parent node, thus helps reducing the number of calls needed in order to gain enough data for the front-end application.
